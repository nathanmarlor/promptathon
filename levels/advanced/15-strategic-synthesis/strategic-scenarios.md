# Strategic Scenarios for Analysis

Complex strategic situations requiring synthesis and scenario planning.

---

## Scenario 1: Market Expansion Decision

**Situation:** Your organisation is considering international expansion. The board has approved exploration but not committed resources. You need to develop a strategic recommendation.

**Inputs to Synthesise:**

*Board Priorities:*
- Growth acceleration (targeting 25% revenue growth)
- Risk management (protect existing business)
- Capital efficiency (limited appetite for large upfront investment)
- Proof points within 18 months

*Market Analysis:*
- Three potential markets identified (Germany, Australia, Japan)
- Germany: largest opportunity, highest complexity
- Australia: smallest opportunity, lowest complexity
- Japan: medium opportunity, requires partnership

*Financial Constraints:*
- £2M available for expansion investment
- Break-even expected within 24 months
- Cannot jeopardise core business profitability

*Competitive Intelligence:*
- Main competitor expanding aggressively (3 new markets this year)
- Risk of being locked out of key markets if delayed
- Competitor facing quality issues in rapid expansion

*Internal Assessment:*
- Strong product-market fit in current markets
- Limited international experience on leadership team
- Operations could support one market well, two would stretch

**Exercise:**

```
Synthesise these inputs and provide:
1. Strategic options (with trade-offs for each)
2. Recommended approach with rationale
3. Key assumptions underlying the recommendation
4. Decisions needed from the board
5. 90-day action plan if approved
```

## Scenario 2: Digital Transformation Prioritisation

**Situation:** Year 2 of a 3-year digital transformation programme. Budget pressure requires reducing scope by 30%. Leadership must decide what to cut.

**Current Portfolio:**

| Initiative | Budget | Progress | Business Value | Risk if Cut |
|------------|--------|----------|----------------|-------------|
| Cloud Migration | £1.2M | 70% done | High (cost saving) | Sunk cost, incomplete |
| Customer Portal | £800K | 40% done | High (revenue) | Competitive disadvantage |
| Data Platform | £600K | 20% done | Medium (enabler) | Blocks future analytics |
| Process Automation | £400K | 60% done | Medium (efficiency) | Slower operations |
| Mobile App | £500K | 30% done | Medium (experience) | Customer complaints |
| Security Upgrade | £300K | 50% done | Low direct, high risk | Compliance exposure |

**Stakeholder Perspectives:**

*CFO:* "Finish what we've started. Sunk costs are real—abandoning 70% complete projects is wasteful."

*CTO:* "Data platform is foundational. Without it, we're building on sand."

*COO:* "Process automation delivers immediate ROI. Don't cut the quick wins."

*CMO:* "Customer-facing initiatives (portal, mobile) are what customers see. Back-office can wait."

*CISO:* "Security isn't optional. Regulatory risk is existential."

**Exercise:**

```
Develop a recommendation for the 30% budget reduction:
1. Analysis framework for prioritisation
2. Recommended cuts with rationale
3. Risks created by each cut and mitigations
4. Stakeholder impact and change management needs
5. Decision criteria for future re-prioritisation
```

## Scenario 3: Competitive Response

**Situation:** Your main competitor just announced a major product launch that directly challenges your core offering. Leadership needs a strategic response within 2 weeks.

**Competitor Announcement:**
- New product at 20% lower price point
- Claims feature parity plus 3 new capabilities you lack
- Aggressive go-to-market (£10M campaign)
- Targeting your top 50 customers directly
- Launch in 90 days

**Your Current Position:**
- Market leader (35% share, competitor at 25%)
- Premium positioning (20% price premium justified by service)
- Strong customer relationships (NPS 72, competitor ~55)
- Roadmap has competing features planned for Q3 (6 months out)
- Limited marketing budget available for response

**Board Questions:**
1. How serious is this threat?
2. Should we respond on price?
3. Can we accelerate our roadmap?
4. How do we protect key accounts?
5. What's our public messaging?

**Exercise:**

```
Develop a strategic response recommendation:
1. Threat assessment (how serious, what's at risk)
2. Response options with trade-offs
3. Recommended approach across:
   - Product response
   - Pricing response
   - Sales/account protection
   - Marketing/messaging
4. Resource requirements
5. Success metrics and monitoring
```

## Scenario 4: Organisational Restructure

**Situation:** Post-acquisition integration requires restructuring two organisations into one. Significant overlap in some areas, gaps in others.

**Current State:**

*Acquiring Company (yours):*
- 850 employees
- Strong in enterprise sales, operations
- Weak in product development, technology
- Culture: process-driven, hierarchical

*Acquired Company:*
- 320 employees
- Strong in product, technology, innovation
- Weak in enterprise sales, scale
- Culture: agile, flat structure

**Synergy Targets:**
- £8M cost savings required (board commitment)
- Headcount reduction of 15-20% expected
- Must retain key talent (especially technology)
- Integration complete within 12 months

**Constraints:**
- Legal entity complexities (different countries)
- Key customer contracts depend on specific individuals
- Product roadmap commitments to customers
- Retention packages expire in 6 months

**Exercise:**

```
Develop an integration approach:
1. Organisational design options (with trade-offs)
2. Recommended structure with rationale
3. Role elimination vs role evolution decisions
4. Talent retention strategy for critical roles
5. Culture integration approach
6. Phased implementation plan
7. Risk assessment and mitigations
```
