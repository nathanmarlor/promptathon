# Strategic Synthesis Frameworks

Frameworks to structure strategic analysis with Claude.

---

## Framework 1: Multi-Input Synthesis

Use when combining diverse strategic inputs into coherent direction.

```
SYNTHESIS PROMPT:

Context: I need to synthesise multiple strategic inputs into a 
coherent recommendation for [decision/direction].

INPUT SOURCES:
1. [Source 1]: [Key points]
2. [Source 2]: [Key points]
3. [Source 3]: [Key points]
[Continue as needed]

SYNTHESIS REQUEST:

Phase 1 - Theme Identification:
- What common themes appear across multiple inputs?
- What priorities are consistently emphasised?
- What constraints are universally acknowledged?

Phase 2 - Tension Mapping:
- Where do inputs contradict each other?
- What trade-offs are implicit in the different perspectives?
- Which tensions represent genuine strategic choices?

Phase 3 - Options Development:
- What strategic options emerge from the synthesis?
- How does each option address the key themes?
- What does each option sacrifice or deprioritise?

Phase 4 - Recommendation:
- Which option best balances the inputs?
- What assumptions underlie this recommendation?
- What needs to be true for this to succeed?

Phase 5 - Path Forward:
- What decisions are needed to proceed?
- What additional information would strengthen the recommendation?
- What's the immediate next step?

## Framework 2: Scenario Planning

Use when exploring alternative futures and their strategic implications.

```
SCENARIO PLANNING PROMPT:

Context: Developing scenarios for [planning horizon] to inform 
[strategic decision/direction].

KEY UNCERTAINTIES (high impact, low predictability):
1. [Uncertainty 1]: [Range of possibilities]
2. [Uncertainty 2]: [Range of possibilities]

SCENARIO DEVELOPMENT REQUEST:

For each scenario, provide:

1. NARRATIVE
   - Descriptive name
   - Story of how this future unfolds
   - Key events and timeline

2. CHARACTERISTICS
   - Market conditions
   - Competitive landscape
   - Customer behaviour
   - Regulatory environment

3. PROBABILITY ASSESSMENT
   - Likelihood estimate
   - Key assumptions
   - Dependent factors

4. STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS
   - Opportunities in this scenario
   - Threats in this scenario
   - Required capabilities
   - Resource implications

CROSS-SCENARIO ANALYSIS:
- "No regret" moves that work across all scenarios
- Scenario-specific bets and their triggers
- Early warning indicators for each scenario
- Recommended hedging strategies
```

## Framework 3: Strategic Options Evaluation

Use when rigorously comparing strategic alternatives.

```
OPTIONS EVALUATION PROMPT:

Context: Evaluating strategic options for [decision].

OPTIONS UNDER CONSIDERATION:
1. [Option 1]: [Brief description]
2. [Option 2]: [Brief description]
3. [Option 3]: [Brief description]

EVALUATION CRITERIA:
- Strategic fit: [How to assess]
- Financial return: [How to assess]
- Risk level: [How to assess]
- Implementation feasibility: [How to assess]
- Stakeholder acceptance: [How to assess]

EVALUATION REQUEST:

For each option:
1. Score against each criterion (with rationale)
2. Key advantages and disadvantages
3. Critical success factors
4. Major risks and mitigations
5. Resource requirements

Comparative analysis:
1. Side-by-side comparison matrix
2. Sensitivity analysis (which criteria changes the answer?)
3. Risk-adjusted ranking
4. Recommendation with clear rationale
5. Conditions that would change the recommendation
```

## Framework 4: Assumption Testing

Use when stress-testing strategic assumptions.

```
ASSUMPTION TESTING PROMPT:

Context: Our strategy for [area] assumes [key assumption].
I want to rigorously test this assumption.

THE ASSUMPTION:
[State the assumption clearly]

CURRENT EVIDENCE:
[What supports this assumption today]

TESTING REQUEST:

1. DEPENDENCY ANALYSIS
   - What else must be true for this assumption to hold?
   - What's the chain of logic?
   - Where are the weakest links?

2. EVIDENCE ASSESSMENT
   - What evidence supports this assumption?
   - What evidence contradicts it?
   - What evidence is missing?

3. FAILURE MODES
   - Under what conditions would this assumption fail?
   - How likely are those conditions?
   - What would trigger a change?

4. IMPACT ANALYSIS
   - If the assumption fails, what breaks?
   - How severe is the impact?
   - How quickly would we know?

5. HEDGING STRATEGIES
   - How can we reduce dependence on this assumption?
   - What early warning indicators should we monitor?
   - What contingency plans should we have ready?

6. DECISION IMPLICATIONS
   - Should we proceed despite the uncertainty?
   - What additional validation should we seek?
   - What decision points should we build in?
```

## Framework 5: Board-Ready Synthesis

Use when preparing strategic recommendations for board/executive review.

```
BOARD SYNTHESIS PROMPT:

Context: Preparing a strategic recommendation on [topic] for 
board/executive review on [date].

SITUATION SUMMARY:
[Brief context]

RECOMMENDATION REQUEST:

Structure as a board-ready document:

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (1 paragraph)
   - The decision being requested
   - The recommendation
   - Why now

2. CONTEXT (half page)
   - What's driving this decision
   - Key constraints and considerations
   - What happens if we don't act

3. OPTIONS CONSIDERED (1 page)
   - Options evaluated
   - Key trade-offs
   - Why alternatives were rejected

4. RECOMMENDATION (1 page)
   - What we recommend
   - Why this option
   - Key assumptions
   - Expected outcomes

5. RISKS & MITIGATIONS (half page)
   - Top 3-5 risks
   - Mitigation strategies
   - Residual risk assessment

6. FINANCIAL IMPACT (half page)
   - Investment required
   - Expected returns
   - Key financial assumptions

7. DECISION REQUESTED
   - Specific approval needed
   - Timeline
   - Next steps if approved

8. APPENDICES
   - Supporting analysis
   - Detailed financials
   - Background materials
```
