# Level 15: Strategic Synthesis & Scenario Planning

| | |
|---|---|
| **Difficulty** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Expert |
| **Time** | 30–45 minutes |
| **Tool** | Claude ([claude.ai](https://claude.ai)) |
| **Skill** | Complex strategic analysis and scenario modelling |

---

## Objective

Use Claude for sophisticated strategic work: synthesising multiple inputs into coherent strategy, developing scenario models, and stress-testing strategic assumptions.

---

## Business Context

Strategic planning requires integrating diverse inputs—market data, stakeholder perspectives, financial constraints, competitive dynamics—into coherent direction. AI can accelerate synthesis and enable rapid scenario exploration that would otherwise take weeks.

## Sample Materials

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [strategic-scenarios.md](strategic-scenarios.md) | Complex strategic situations for analysis |
| [synthesis-frameworks.md](synthesis-frameworks.md) | Frameworks for strategic synthesis |
| [sample-strategy-inputs.md](sample-strategy-inputs.md) | Multi-source inputs for synthesis exercises |

---

## Strategic Applications

### 1. Multi-Input Strategy Synthesis

Combine disparate inputs into unified strategic direction:
- Board feedback and priorities
- Market research and trends
- Financial constraints and projections
- Competitive intelligence
- Internal capability assessments
- Stakeholder concerns

### 2. Scenario Planning & Stress Testing

Develop and analyse alternative futures:
- Best case / base case / worst case scenarios
- Sensitivity analysis on key assumptions
- Trigger points and decision criteria
- Contingency planning

### 3. Strategic Options Evaluation

Rigorous analysis of strategic choices:
- Multi-criteria decision frameworks
- Risk-adjusted return analysis
- Stakeholder impact assessment
- Implementation feasibility

## Starter Prompts

### Strategic Synthesis

```
Context: I need to synthesise multiple inputs into a coherent strategic 
direction for [business area/initiative].

Inputs:
1. [Board guidance/priorities]
2. [Market analysis findings]
3. [Financial constraints]
4. [Competitive position]
5. [Internal capabilities]

Language: Strategic, executive-level. Balance ambition with pragmatism.
Surface tensions and trade-offs explicitly.

Request:
1. Identify common themes across inputs
2. Surface contradictions or tensions that need resolution
3. Propose 2-3 strategic options that address the inputs
4. Recommend a direction with clear rationale
5. Identify key assumptions underlying the recommendation
6. Flag decisions that need to be made to proceed
```

### Scenario Development

```
Context: Developing scenarios for [strategic decision/planning horizon].

Key uncertainties:
- [Uncertainty 1: e.g., market growth rate]
- [Uncertainty 2: e.g., competitive response]
- [Uncertainty 3: e.g., regulatory environment]

Request:
1. Develop 3-4 distinct, plausible scenarios
2. For each scenario: narrative description, key characteristics, 
   probability assessment, strategic implications
3. Identify "no regret" moves that work across scenarios
4. Identify trigger points that would signal which scenario is emerging
5. Recommend scenario-specific contingencies
```

### Assumption Stress Testing

```
Context: Our strategy assumes [key assumption]. I want to stress-test 
this assumption rigorously.

Current strategy: [brief description]
Key assumption: [the assumption to test]

Request:
1. What would need to be true for this assumption to hold?
2. What evidence supports or contradicts it?
3. What would invalidate this assumption?
4. If the assumption fails, what's the impact on strategy?
5. What early warning signs should we monitor?
6. What hedging strategies should we consider?
```

## Your Task

**Choose one application:**

**Option A:** Synthesise the sample strategy inputs into a strategic recommendation

**Option B:** Develop scenarios for a strategic decision you're facing

**Option C:** Stress-test a key assumption in your current strategy

---

## Success Criteria

✅ Analysis integrates multiple perspectives coherently  
✅ Trade-offs and tensions are surfaced explicitly  
✅ Recommendations are actionable and defensible  
✅ Assumptions are clearly stated and testable  
✅ Output is suitable for board or executive discussion  

---

## Key Technique: Tensions Before Resolution

> **The insight:** When synthesising multiple inputs, explicitly ask for contradictions and tensions BEFORE asking for recommendations.

**Weak:** "Based on these inputs, what should our strategy be?"

**Strong:** "Before recommending anything, identify: (1) Where do these inputs agree? (2) Where do they contradict? (3) Which tensions require a choice rather than a compromise? Then recommend, explicitly stating which tensions you're resolving and how."

This produces recommendations that acknowledge trade-offs rather than papering over them.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Asking for consensus | Ignores real trade-offs | Ask for tensions explicitly |
| Too many inputs at once | Claude loses coherence | Process in stages |
| No decision framing | Analysis without focus | State what decision needs to be made |
| Accepting generic strategy | Could apply to anyone | Demand specificity to your situation |

---

## Professional Tips

| Tip | Rationale |
|-----|-----------|
| **Start with the question** | "What decision are we trying to make?" focuses analysis |
| **Surface tensions** | Disagreements often reveal the real strategic choices |
| **Quantify where possible** | Numbers enable sharper trade-off discussions |
| **Identify decision points** | Clarity on what needs deciding accelerates progress |
