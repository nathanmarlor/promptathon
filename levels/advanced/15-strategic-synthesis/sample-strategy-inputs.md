# Sample Strategy Inputs for Synthesis Exercise

Multiple inputs to synthesise into a strategic recommendation.

---

## Context: Annual Strategy Refresh

Your organisation is conducting its annual strategy refresh. You've gathered inputs from multiple sources and need to synthesise them into a coherent strategic direction for the board.

---

## Input 1: Board Chair Feedback

*From: Annual board strategy discussion*

"We're pleased with the progress over the past year, but we're concerned about three things:

First, growth. We've grown 12% when we targeted 20%. The market is growing faster than we are, which means we're losing share. That's not acceptable.

Second, dependency. 60% of our revenue comes from 5 customers. That concentration risk keeps me up at night. We need diversification.

Third, investment. We've under-invested in technology for years. The cracks are starting to show. We need a serious technology refresh, but we can't crater profitability to fund it.

For next year, I want to see a strategy that addresses all three—ideally without having to choose between them."

- Several niche players gaining in specific verticals

**Customer Trends:**
- Increasing demand for digital self-service

## Input 3: CFO Financial Perspective

*From: Finance team analysis*

**Current Financial Position:**
- Revenue: £85M (target was £92M)
- EBITDA margin: 18% (target was 20%)
- Cash position: £12M
- Debt capacity: £25M available

**Key Concerns:**
1. Revenue per customer declining (price pressure)
2. Customer acquisition cost increasing (competition for new logos)
3. Technology debt creating operational inefficiency
4. Margin compression if we try to compete on price

**Investment Capacity:**
- Can fund £5-8M in strategic initiatives without debt
- Can fund £15-20M if willing to use debt facility
- Cannot fund more than £20M without equity raise

**Financial Guardrails:**
- Must maintain 15% EBITDA margin minimum
- Cannot increase net debt above 2x EBITDA
- Board expects dividend continuation

## Input 4: CTO Technology Assessment

*From: Technology strategy review*

**Current State:**
- Core platform is 8 years old
- Technical debt estimated at £4M to remediate
- Architecture doesn't support modern integration requirements
- Mobile experience rated "poor" by customers
- Data infrastructure inadequate for analytics/AI

**Technology Options:**

*Option A: Incremental Modernisation (£3M over 2 years)*
- Lower risk, lower reward
- Addresses immediate pain points
- Doesn't solve architectural limitations
- 18-month implementation

*Option B: Platform Transformation (£12M over 3 years)*
- Higher risk, higher reward
- Solves underlying issues
- Enables new capabilities
- 30-month implementation

*Option C: Acquire Capability (£8-15M)*
- Fastest to market
- Brings technology and talent
- Integration risk
- 12-month to full integration

**Recommendation:** "We can't compete long-term without a platform transformation. But we can't do everything at once. I recommend a phased approach starting with the highest-impact customer-facing capabilities."

## Input 5: Commercial Team Input

*From: Sales and Marketing leadership*

**Current Performance:**
- New customer acquisition down 15%
- Existing customer expansion up 8%
- Win rate declining (from 35% to 28%)
- Losing to CompetitorA on enterprise, CompetitorB on mid-market

**Key Challenges:**
- Product gaps vs competitors (especially analytics, mobile)
- Price pressure in competitive situations
- Sales cycle lengthening (more stakeholders involved)
- Customer success under-resourced (limiting expansion revenue)

**Opportunities Identified:**
- Financial services vertical: strong early traction, could be focus area
- Existing customer expansion: significant untapped potential
- Partnership channel: underdeveloped compared to competitors

**What We Need to Win:**
1. Product competitiveness (close the gaps)
2. Vertical specialisation (go deeper in 2-3 industries)
3. Customer success investment (protect and grow existing base)
4. Price positioning clarity (premium with justification, or competitive)
