## Input 1: Project Summary for Business Case

**Project:** Customer Portal Modernisation  
**Sponsor:** Sarah Mitchell, VP Customer Experience  
**Budget Request:** £425,000

**Problem Statement:**
Our customer portal was built 7 years ago and is showing its age. Customer complaints about the portal have increased 45% year-over-year. The most common issues are slow load times (averaging 8 seconds vs industry benchmark of 2 seconds), limited mobile functionality, and inability to complete common tasks without calling support.

**Current State:**
- 15,000 active portal users
- 12% of customers avoid portal entirely (call support instead)
- Support cost for portal-avoidable calls: £320,000 annually
- Customer satisfaction score for portal: 3.2/5 (company average: 4.1/5)
- Portal contributes to 23% of customer churn (exit survey data)

**Proposed Solution:**
Complete redesign and rebuild of customer portal using modern architecture. New portal will feature responsive mobile design, single sign-on integration, self-service capabilities for 80% of common requests, and real-time data visibility.

**Expected Benefits:**
- Reduce portal-avoidable support calls by 60% (£192,000 annual savings)
- Improve customer satisfaction score to 4.3/5
- Reduce customer churn attributable to portal by 50%
- Enable 3 new self-service features (returns, account changes, order tracking)

**Timeline:**
- Q1: Discovery and design
- Q2: Development Phase 1 (core features)
- Q3: Development Phase 2 (advanced features) + Testing
- Q4: Phased rollout and optimisation

**Risks:**
- Integration complexity with legacy systems
- User adoption of new interface
- Data migration accuracy
- Resource availability (competing priorities)

## Input 2: Strategy Update Content

**Strategy:** Digital Transformation Programme 2025

**Context:**
Following the board's approval of our 3-year digital transformation programme in January, we have completed the first two quarters of implementation. This update covers progress, challenges, and proposed adjustments.

**Programme Objectives:**
1. Modernise core technology infrastructure
2. Enable data-driven decision making across the business
3. Improve customer experience through digital channels
4. Build digital capabilities in our workforce

**Q1-Q2 Progress:**

*Infrastructure (Objective 1):*
- Cloud migration 65% complete (target: 60%) ✓
- Legacy system retirement on track
- Security upgrades completed ahead of schedule

*Data & Analytics (Objective 2):*
- Data warehouse implementation 40% complete (target: 50%) ⚠️
- Delay due to data quality issues in source systems
- Mitigation: Added data cleansing phase, revised timeline by 6 weeks

*Customer Experience (Objective 3):*
- Mobile app launched (12,000 downloads, 4.2 star rating)
- Website redesign in UAT, launching Q3
- Chatbot pilot showing 35% deflection rate

*Digital Skills (Objective 4):*
- 450 employees completed digital literacy training
- 25 "digital champions" trained to support peers
- Partnership with external training provider established

**Budget Status:**
- Approved: £4.2M
- Spent to date: £1.8M
- Committed: £2.1M
- Remaining: £0.3M
- Status: On track (slight underspend due to contractor timing)

**Key Risks:**
1. Data quality issues may further delay analytics workstream
2. Change management fatigue—third major initiative this year
3. Vendor dependency on cloud migration partner

**Proposed Adjustments:**
1. Extend data warehouse timeline by 6 weeks (new completion: Q3 Week 8)
2. Increase change management investment by £50,000
3. Accelerate Objective 3 deliverables given customer demand
