| | |
|---|---|
| **Difficulty** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Advanced |
| **Time** | 25–30 minutes |
| **Tool** | Claude ([claude.ai](https://claude.ai)) |
| **Skill** | Chain analysis steps for complex deliverables |

## Objective

Design and execute multi-step analytical workflows where each step builds on previous outputs, producing sophisticated deliverables from complex inputs.

---

## Business Context

Complex analysis often requires multiple stages: gathering information, processing it, analysing patterns, synthesising findings, and producing outputs. Claude can maintain context across these steps within a conversation.

## Sample Materials

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [workflow-examples.md](workflow-examples.md) | Complete multi-step workflow examples |
| [sample-documents.md](sample-documents.md) | Source materials for workflow exercises |

## Your Task

**Step 1:** Define the workflow stages

**Step 2:** Execute each step, reviewing output before proceeding

**Step 3:** Build toward a final synthesised deliverable

**Step 4:** Validate the output against requirements

## Workflow Pattern

```
Step 1: Extract/Gather
    ↓
Step 2: Process/Organise
    ↓
Step 3: Analyse/Compare
    ↓
Step 4: Synthesise/Conclude
    ↓
Step 5: Produce deliverable
```

---

## Success Criteria

✅ Each step produces clear, usable output  
✅ Workflow maintains coherence across steps  
✅ Final deliverable addresses the original need  
✅ Total effort is less than manual alternative
