## Document 4: Internal Strategy Input (Sales Team)

**From:** VP Sales  
**Subject:** Strategy Input - Sales Perspective

Key observations from the field:

**What's Working:**
- Product reliability has improved significantly
- Customer success team is helping with retention
- New pricing tiers landing well

**What's Hurting Us:**
- Losing enterprise deals to CompetaCorp on security features

1. Better reporting and dashboards (every deal)
2. Salesforce integration (enterprise deals)
3. Mobile app improvements (especially field teams)
4. AI/automation features (increasingly mentioned)
5. Industry-specific configurations

**Competitive Intel:**
- TechRival cutting prices 15-20% in competitive deals
- CompetaCorp offering extended payment terms
- Both competitors have stronger partner ecosystems

**My Recommendations:**
