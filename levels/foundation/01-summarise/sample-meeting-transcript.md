**Sarah Chen:** Thanks everyone for joining. Let's get started—we have a full agenda. First item is the warehouse automation update. James, where are we?

**James Liu:** Good news overall. The pilot at the Leeds facility hit 94% accuracy in pick-and-pack last month, up from 87% in October. We're now confident we can roll out to Manchester in Q1.

**Sarah Chen:** That's ahead of schedule. What drove the improvement?

**James Liu:** Two things. First, the team recalibrated the sensors after we identified a humidity issue affecting readings. Second, we added a secondary verification step that catches about 6% of errors before dispatch.

**Emma Rodriguez:** Is the secondary verification adding time to the process?

**James Liu:** About 12 seconds per order on average. But we're saving more than that on returns processing, so net positive.

**Sarah Chen:** Good. Any blockers for Manchester?

**James Liu:** One concern—we need to upgrade the network infrastructure at Manchester. The current setup can't handle the data throughput. I've got a quote from IT: £45,000 for the upgrade, not in my current budget.

**Sarah Chen:** Let's flag that for the capital review next week. Emma, can you add it to the agenda?

**Emma Rodriguez:** Will do. I'll need the business case from James by Monday.

**James Liu:** You'll have it tomorrow.

**Sarah Chen:** Perfect. Moving on—customer service metrics. Emma?

**Emma Rodriguez:** Mixed picture. Call abandonment rate improved to 4.2%, down from 5.8% last quarter. First-call resolution is up to 78%. But we're seeing a spike in complaints about delivery tracking—up 23% month-over-month.

**Chris Taylor:** That's likely the carrier issue we discussed last month. The tracking API has been unreliable since their system migration.

**Emma Rodriguez:** That's our read too. We've escalated to their account team, but no resolution yet.

**Sarah Chen:** What's the fallback if they don't fix it?

**Chris Taylor:** We could switch to the backup carrier for affected routes. Adds about 50p per package but gives us reliable tracking.

**Sarah Chen:** How much volume are we talking?

**Chris Taylor:** About 15% of our shipments. So roughly £30,000 per month in additional costs if we switch everything.

**Sarah Chen:** That's significant. Let's give the primary carrier until end of month to resolve. If no improvement, we switch the worst-affected routes only. Chris, can you identify which routes to prioritise?

**Chris Taylor:** I'll have that analysis ready by next Friday.

**Amy Foster:** Quick question—are customers being compensated for the tracking issues?

**Emma Rodriguez:** We've been offering £5 credits for affected orders. About 200 claims so far, so £1,000 in credits issued.

**Sarah Chen:** That's reasonable. Keep tracking it. Amy, inventory update?

**Amy Foster:** We're in decent shape for the holiday season. Stock coverage is at 6.2 weeks across core SKUs. Two exceptions: the new electronics line is at 3.1 weeks—supplier constraints—and we're overstocked on outdoor furniture at 11 weeks.

**Sarah Chen:** The electronics shortage—is that affecting sales?

**Amy Foster:** Starting to. We've had to mark three SKUs as "limited availability" on the website. Estimated lost sales: £85,000 last month.

**Sarah Chen:** That's not acceptable. What are our options?

**Amy Foster:** I've been working with the supplier. They can air-freight an emergency shipment that would get us to 5 weeks coverage. Cost is £22,000 for freight.

**James Liu:** That's expensive but probably worth it given the lost sales.

**Sarah Chen:** Agreed. Amy, go ahead with the air freight. Let's not lose more sales.

**Amy Foster:** I'll confirm the order today.

**Sarah Chen:** And the outdoor furniture—what's the plan to clear that?

**Amy Foster:** Marketing is running a promotion next week. 25% off selected items. Forecast is we'll move about 40% of excess stock.

**Sarah Chen:** Good. Let's review again in January if we're still overstocked.

**Sarah Chen:** Last item—Mark sent notes on the sustainability initiative. Key point is we're on track for the packaging reduction target. 15% reduction in plastic achieved, target was 12%. He's proposing we increase next year's target to 20%. Any objections?

**Emma Rodriguez:** That seems aggressive. Do we have line of sight to how we'd get there?

**Sarah Chen:** Good question. I'll ask Mark to present options at next month's review before we commit. Any other business?

**Chris Taylor:** Just a heads up—I'll be on leave the last two weeks of December. James is covering carrier issues in my absence.

**Sarah Chen:** Noted. Thanks everyone. Let's close there.
