All,

I've reviewed the latest status update from the implementation team. Based on the integration testing results, I don't believe we can hit the March 15th go-live date without significant risk.

The vendor's API documentation was incomplete, and the team has spent two additional weeks on integration work that wasn't in the original plan. We're now looking at April 5th as the earliest realistic date.

I know this creates challenges for the Q1 targets, but I'd rather delay than launch something that isn't ready. The reputational risk of a failed launch outweighs the financial impact of a 3-week delay.

Thoughts?

Sarah,

I understand the technical concerns, but a 3-week delay puts us past the end of Q1. We committed to the board that Phoenix would contribute $1.2M in Q1 savings. If we slip to April, we'll miss that entirely and need to explain the variance.

Is there any way to launch with reduced functionality on March 15th and add the remaining features in a Phase 2? That would let us claim the milestone even if we're not at 100%.

I need to update the board by Wednesday.

Michael, Sarah,

I've spoken with the tech lead. A phased approach is possible, but it comes with trade-offs:

**Phase 1 (March 15):** Core transaction processing. This covers about 60% of the projected savings. We could claim a partial go-live.

**Phase 2 (April 5):** Reporting and analytics modules. This is where the remaining 40% of savings come from.

The risk with Phase 1 is that we'd need to run parallel systems for 3 weeks, which creates operational overhead and some data reconciliation challenges. Operations would need to allocate 2-3 FTEs to manage the transition period.

Sarah, can your team absorb that?

Jennifer,

We can make it work, but I want everyone to understand the implications:

1. We'll need to pause the EMEA rollout planning to free up the resources
2. There's a risk of data inconsistency between systems during the parallel period
3. My team will be stretched thin—if anything else goes wrong in March, we won't have buffer

I can support the phased approach if:
- We get explicit sign-off that EMEA delay is acceptable
- IT commits to daily sync meetings during the parallel period
- We have a clear rollback plan if Phase 1 encounters critical issues

Can we get a decision call scheduled for tomorrow? I need to brief my team by end of week.

Team,

Thanks for the thorough analysis. Here's my take:

1. The phased approach makes sense. Let's do it.
2. I'm comfortable with the EMEA delay—we can absorb that.
3. Jennifer, please ensure the rollback plan is documented before we proceed.
4. Michael, frame this to the board as a "phased launch" not a delay. We're de-risking, not slipping.

Sarah, I know this puts pressure on your team. Let's discuss what support you need in our 1:1 Thursday.

Can someone send a revised timeline and RACI by Wednesday COB? I want to close this out before the board meeting.

David,

Will do. I'll have the rollback plan documented by tomorrow EOD and the revised RACI by Wednesday morning.

One additional item: we should notify the vendor about the phased approach. They may need to adjust their support coverage. I'll handle that communication.

All,

Thanks David. I'll update the board materials to reflect the phased approach. 

For the record, I'll be reporting:
- Phase 1 go-live: March 15 (60% of savings = ~$720K in Q1)
- Phase 2 go-live: April 5 (remaining 40% = ~$480K in Q2)

Sarah, can you validate these numbers align with your operational projections?

Michael,

Numbers look right to me. The 60/40 split aligns with where the savings come from.

I'll have my resource plan updated by EOD today showing the parallel period staffing.

One request: can we add a checkpoint on March 8th (one week before Phase 1) to confirm we're still on track? I'd rather know early if we need to adjust.
