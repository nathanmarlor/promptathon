## Original Draft

**To:** Regional Sales Team  
**Subject:** Changes to the commission structure  

Hi everyone,

I wanted to reach out to let you know about some changes that are going to be happening to our commission structure starting next quarter. I know this might not be what you want to hear, but I think it's important that I'm transparent with you about what's going on.

Unfortunately, due to various factors including market conditions and the need to align with corporate strategy, we've had to make some adjustments to how commissions will be calculated going forward. I want to be clear that this wasn't my decision alone and I fought hard to minimise the impact on all of you.

The main changes are as follows:
- The base commission rate will be adjusted from 8% to 6.5% for standard product lines
- However, we're introducing accelerators for the new enterprise solutions which can take you up to 10% if you hit certain thresholds
- The threshold for quarterly bonuses is being raised from £75,000 to £85,000

I understand if you're frustrated or have concerns. Please know that my door is always open if you want to discuss this further. I really value each and every one of you and I hope you understand that these changes are necessary for the long-term health of the business.

We'll be having a town hall next Tuesday at 3pm to go through the details and answer any questions. I really hope you can all attend because I think it's important we discuss this as a team.

Thanks for your understanding and continued hard work.

Best regards,
Alex

## Issues to Address

When practising with this draft, consider these problems:

1. **Tone:** Defensive and apologetic throughout
2. **Structure:** Buries key information in the middle
3. **Length:** Could be significantly shorter
4. **Clarity:** Vague about the "why" and the opportunity
5. **Call to action:** Weak close

## Exercise Prompt

Try this prompt to improve the draft:

```
Context: This is an announcement about commission structure changes. 
The changes include a base rate reduction (8% to 6.5%) but also new 
accelerators up to 10% for enterprise solutions.

Language: Confident and direct, not defensive or apologetic. 
Focus on the opportunity, not the reduction.

Examples: Structure as:
1. Direct opening stating what's changing
2. Clear bullet points with the specifics
3. The opportunity (accelerators)
4. Next steps

Audience: Sales team who will be concerned about their earnings.
They need facts, not reassurance.

Request: Rewrite to be half the length, lead with facts not feelings,
and frame the accelerators as a genuine opportunity. No apologetic language.
```
