## Objective

Develop the ability to rapidly draft and iteratively improve written communications using AI as a collaborative tool rather than a replacement for your judgement.

---

## Business Context

Written communication benefits from iteration. AI can accelerate drafting and refinement whilst maintaining quality, but requires clear direction to produce usable outputs.

---

## Your Task

**Choose one approach:**

**Option A — Draft from scratch:**
Use the scenario prompts in this folder, or select a communication you need to send this week

**Option B — Rework existing:**
Use the sample draft provided, or find something you've already drafted that needs improvement

---

## Sample Materials

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [sample-draft-to-improve.md](sample-draft-to-improve.md) | A draft email that needs tone and clarity improvements |
| [scenario-prompts.md](scenario-prompts.md) | Realistic scenarios to practise drafting from scratch |

## Starter Prompts

### Drafting New Communications

```
Context: I need to inform [stakeholder/team] about [situation].
This is [urgent/routine/sensitive] and the relationship context is [description].

Language: [Professional/diplomatic/direct/warm].
Avoid: [specific phrases or approaches to avoid].

Examples: Structure as:
- Opening: [what to lead with]
- Body: [2-3 key points in order of importance]
- Close: [call to action or next steps]

Audience: [Who], who [their knowledge level and concerns].
After reading, they should [specific action or understanding].

Request: Draft a [length] email that achieves [specific goal].
The reader should be able to respond within [timeframe].
```

### Reworking Existing Content

```
Context: I've written this message but it's [problem: too long/wrong tone/unclear/defensive].
The current version achieves [what it does well] but fails to [gap].

Language: Make it [more concise/more confident/less aggressive/warmer].
Maintain: [aspects to preserve].

Examples: Keep the overall structure but [specific change needed].
The final version should read like [reference or description].

Audience: [Who]—they need to [action/understanding].
They will likely feel [emotion] when reading; I want them to feel [target emotion].

Request: Rewrite to:
- [Specific improvement 1]
- [Specific improvement 2]
- Maximum [length]

Show me what you changed and why.
```

### Tone Adjustment

```
Context: This message currently sounds [defensive/aggressive/weak/bureaucratic].
I need to convey the same information but land differently.

Language: Rewrite to sound [confident/diplomatic/warm/direct] whilst 
keeping the same substantive points.

Examples: 
- Change phrases like "I think we might consider..." to direct recommendations
- Replace "Unfortunately..." openings with forward-looking framing
- [Other specific examples relevant to your situation]

Audience: [Who]—our relationship is [context: new/established/strained/strong].

Request: Same message, different tone. 
Highlight the specific phrases you changed and explain the reasoning.
```

## Iteration Technique

Effective drafting is iterative. Use this progression:

```
Prompt 1: "Draft a message to the team about the deadline change"

Prompt 2: "Make it shorter and add appropriate urgency"

Prompt 3: "Lead with the 'why' before announcing the new date"

Prompt 4: "The opening is too defensive. Make it confident and solution-oriented"
```

Each iteration refines the output. Don't expect perfection from the first prompt.

---

## Success Criteria

✅ Message achieves its intended purpose  
✅ Tone is appropriate for the audience and situation  
✅ Content is clear and free of ambiguity  
✅ Call to action (if any) is specific and achievable  
✅ Length is appropriate—no padding

## Professional Tips

| Tip | Rationale |
|-----|-----------|
| **State the goal** | What should the reader DO after reading? |
| **Be specific about problems** | "Too long" is less useful than "cut by 50%, focus on X" |
| **Iterate deliberately** | First draft is rarely final—plan for 2-3 refinements |
| **Preserve your voice** | Edit the output to sound like you, not generic AI |

---

## Common Pitfalls

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Output sounds generic | Add more context about your style and relationship |
| Tone inconsistent | Request a complete rewrite rather than partial edits |
| Too formal/stiff | Specify "conversational" or provide example of your usual style |
| Missing key points | List must-include elements explicitly in your request |

---

## Key Technique: Iterative Refinement

> **The insight:** Don't try to get it right in one prompt. Use a sequence of targeted refinements.

**One-shot approach (often fails):**
"Write a professional email about the deadline change that's confident but empathetic, 150 words, with a clear call to action..."

**Iterative approach (usually succeeds):**
```
Prompt 1: "Draft an email about the deadline change"
Prompt 2: "Make it shorter and more direct"
Prompt 3: "The tone is too apologetic. Make it confident."
Prompt 4: "Lead with the 'why' before the new date"
```

Each iteration focuses on one improvement. This produces better results than overloaded prompts.

---

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Overloaded first prompt | Confused output | Start simple, iterate to refine |
| No tone specification | Generic voice | Describe tone explicitly with examples |
| Accepting first draft | Missed improvement | Always iterate at least once |
| Vague feedback | Same problems persist | Be specific: "change X to Y" |

---

## Debrief Questions

1. How much editing did the final output require?
2. What prompt refinements produced the biggest improvements?
3. Where did AI struggle to capture your intent?
