# Sample Strategic Choice: Market Expansion

Use this scenario to practise strategic decision analysis.

---

## The Decision

Your company is considering expanding into a new geographic market. You need to recommend which of two markets to prioritise, given that resources only allow for one expansion this year.

---

## Option A: Germany

**Market size:** €2.4B addressable market for your product category

**Competitive landscape:**
- 2 established local competitors with 60% market share combined
- 1 US competitor entered 2 years ago, struggling (rumoured to be exiting)
- No dominant player—fragmented remaining 40%

**Entry approach:**
- Would require local entity setup (€150K legal/admin)
- Need to hire country manager and 3-person sales team
- Localisation of product required (German language, GDPR++ compliance)
- Estimated 18 months to break-even on country P&L

**Opportunities:**
- Strong existing brand awareness (you've had inbound enquiries)
- Cultural alignment with your product's value proposition
- Gateway to DACH region (Austria, Switzerland)
- Stable regulatory environment

**Risks:**
- High cost of doing business (salaries, real estate)
- German buyers are notoriously demanding—quality expectations very high
- Long sales cycles (relationship-driven)
- Your main competitor is also evaluating Germany

---

## Option B: Australia

**Market size:** A$800M addressable market for your product category

**Competitive landscape:**
- 1 dominant local competitor with 45% market share
- US competitors have struggled with timezone/support issues
- Growing market—15% YoY growth vs 5% in Europe

**Entry approach:**
- Simpler entity setup (A$50K legal/admin)
- Could initially serve from existing Singapore hub
- Minimal localisation required (English-speaking)
- Estimated 12 months to break-even on country P&L

**Opportunities:**
- Faster path to revenue
- English-speaking market—easier to support
- Growing market with less competition
- Could serve New Zealand from same base
- Time zone overlap with existing APAC operations

**Risks:**
- Smaller total addressable market
- Dominant competitor may respond aggressively
- Geographic distance from HQ (travel costs, management attention)
- Currency volatility (AUD)

---

## Context for Your Decision

**Company situation:**
- £50M annual revenue, profitable but not by much
- Just closed Series C funding with mandate to expand internationally
- Currently operate in UK, France, and US
- Board expects one new market launched this year
- Resource constraint: can fund one expansion properly, or two poorly

**Strategic priorities:**
- Demonstrate international scalability to support future funding/exit
- Reach £100M revenue within 3 years
- Maintain profitability (no "growth at all costs")

**Internal considerations:**
- Your CEO has strong network in Germany (previously worked there)
- Your VP Sales thinks Australia is "easier" but less impressive to investors
- Product team is concerned about German localisation effort

## Your Task

Use this scenario to practise:

1. **Multi-criteria analysis:** Compare options across multiple dimensions
2. **Risk assessment:** Identify what could go wrong with each option
3. **Recommendation development:** Structure a clear, defensible recommendation
4. **Devil's advocate:** Stress-test whichever option you prefer

## Sample Prompt

```
Context: My company needs to choose between expanding to Germany (€2.4B market, 
complex entry, 18-month break-even) or Australia (A$800M market, simpler entry, 
12-month break-even). We can only do one well this year.

Strategic context: £50M revenue company, Series C funded, need to reach £100M 
in 3 years while staying profitable. This expansion needs to demonstrate 
international scalability.

Language: Strategic and analytical. Help me think through this like a 
board presentation.

Request:
1. Framework: What criteria should I evaluate these options against?
2. Analysis: Score each option against those criteria
3. Risk map: What are the top 3 things that could go wrong with each?
4. Recommendation: Which would you choose and why?
5. Counter-argument: What's the strongest case for the option you didn't choose?
```
