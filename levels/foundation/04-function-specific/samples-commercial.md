## Sample 2: Customer Email Thread

**Context:** A customer who has been with you for 2 years is expressing frustration. They're not threatening to leave, but the tone has shifted. You need to respond appropriately.

### Customer Email

From: procurement@industrialwidgets.com
Subject: RE: Support Ticket #4521 - Still Unresolved

Hi,

This is the third time I'm following up on this issue. We first reported the data sync problem three weeks ago and we're still seeing intermittent failures.

I understand that your team has been working on it, but the lack of resolution is impacting our operations. We had to manually reconcile inventory data twice last week, which cost us approximately 12 hours of staff time.

We chose your platform specifically for its reliability. At this point, I need:
1. A clear explanation of what's causing this issue
2. A committed timeline for resolution
3. Assurance this won't recur

I have a QBR with our leadership next week and they're going to ask about this. I'd appreciate a call before Friday if possible.

Regards,
Sarah Mitchell
Operations Director
Industrial Widgets Ltd

### Exercise: Prepare response strategy

```
Context: Long-standing customer (2 years), expressing frustration about an 
unresolved support issue affecting their operations. They're not threatening 
to leave but trust is eroding. QBR with their leadership next week.

Request: 
1. Analyse the email—what are the explicit and implicit concerns?
2. What's the appropriate response tone?
3. Draft a response that: acknowledges the issue appropriately, provides 
   the information they requested, and offers to support their internal QBR
4. What proactive steps should we take beyond the email response?
```
