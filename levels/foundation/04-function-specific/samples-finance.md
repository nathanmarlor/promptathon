## Sample 1: Variance Analysis

**Context:** You need to explain Q3 financial performance to non-finance stakeholders. The numbers tell a story, but it needs to be translated.

---

### Q3 Financial Summary

| Metric | Budget | Actual | Variance | % |
|--------|--------|--------|----------|---|
| Revenue | £12.4M | £11.8M | (£0.6M) | -4.8% |
| COGS | £7.4M | £7.6M | (£0.2M) | -2.7% |
| Gross Profit | £5.0M | £4.2M | (£0.8M) | -16.0% |
| Gross Margin % | 40.3% | 35.6% | -4.7pp | |
| Operating Expenses | £3.8M | £3.5M | £0.3M | 7.9% |
| Operating Profit | £1.2M | £0.7M | (£0.5M) | -41.7% |

**Revenue Variance Drivers:**
- Enterprise segment: (£0.4M) — 2 large deals slipped to Q4
- Mid-market segment: (£0.3M) — longer sales cycles than forecast
- SMB segment: £0.1M — new self-serve channel outperforming

**COGS Variance Drivers:**
- Cloud infrastructure: (£0.15M) — usage higher than modeled
- Support costs: (£0.05M) — additional contractors for product issue

**OpEx Favourability:**
- Marketing: £0.2M — delayed campaign spend to Q4
- Hiring: £0.1M — 3 open roles unfilled longer than planned

---

### Exercise: Variance explanation

```
Context: Q3 results showing operating profit down 42% vs budget.
Main drivers: revenue shortfall from delayed deals, gross margin 
compression from higher cloud costs. Some favourable OpEx variance.

Language: Plain English, no jargon. Lead with business impact.

Examples: Structure as:
- What happened (headline)
- Why it matters
- What we're doing about it

Audience: Business unit leaders, not finance people. They want implications, 
not accounting mechanics.

Request: 
1. Explain the Q3 performance in plain English (under 200 words)
2. Focus on what it means for the business, not accounting mechanics
3. Identify the 2-3 things that matter most
4. Suggest what questions leaders should be asking
5. Frame it as "here's what happened and what we're doing about it"
```

## Sample 2: Business Case Scenario

**Context:** A business case has been submitted for approval. You need to prepare to challenge it.

---

### Business Case Summary: Customer Portal Upgrade

**Investment Request:** £450,000  
**Payback Period (claimed):** 18 months  
**NPV (claimed):** £280,000 over 3 years

**Proposal:**
Upgrade customer self-service portal to reduce support call volume and improve customer satisfaction.

**Costs:**
- Platform licensing: £120,000 (3-year)
- Implementation services: £180,000
- Internal project team: £100,000 (6 months of time)
- Training and change management: £50,000

**Benefits (as stated):**
- Reduce support calls by 30% = £180,000/year savings (based on current cost of £600K)
- Reduce customer churn by 2% = £150,000/year (based on customer lifetime value)
- Improve NPS by 10 points = "significant brand value"

**Assumptions:**
- Implementation completed in 6 months
- Full adoption within 3 months of launch
- Call deflection achieved immediately
- No additional ongoing costs

**Risks Identified:**
- Implementation delays
- User adoption

---

### Exercise: Business case challenge

```
Context: £450K investment request for customer portal upgrade.
Claims 18-month payback based on call deflection and churn reduction.
You need to prepare questions for the finance review meeting.

Language: Critical, thorough. Challenge assumptions without being dismissive.

Examples: Structure as:
- Assumptions to test
- Questions to ask
- Weaknesses identified
- Information gaps
- Recommendation

Audience: Me—preparing to challenge this case in a finance review.

Request:
1. What assumptions should be stress-tested?
2. What questions will a sceptical CFO ask?
3. Where is this business case weakest?
4. What additional information should be requested?
5. If you had to approve or reject based on this, which would you choose and why?
```

## Sample 3: Quick Ratio Exercise

**Context:** You've been asked to explain a metric to someone unfamiliar with it.

---

### The Question

"The board materials mention our 'quick ratio improved from 1.1 to 1.4' — can you explain what that means and whether it's good?"

---

### Exercise: Explain for non-finance audience

```
Context: Board member (non-financial background) asking about 
quick ratio improvement from 1.1 to 1.4.

Language: Plain English. No jargon. Use analogies.

Examples: Structure as:
- What it is (simple definition)
- Why it matters (practical impact)
- What the change means (good/bad and why)

Audience: Board member without financial background—they need to 
understand significance without a finance lesson.

Request: Explain in under 100 words:
1. What quick ratio measures
2. Why the improvement from 1.1 to 1.4 matters
3. What it means for the business in practical terms
```
