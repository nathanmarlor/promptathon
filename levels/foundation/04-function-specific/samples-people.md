## Sample 2: Organisation Change Scenario

**Context:** Your department is reorganising. You need to draft the announcement.

---

### The Change

**What's happening:**
- Marketing department is restructuring from product-aligned teams to customer-segment-aligned teams
- Three teams (Product Marketing, Brand, Digital) becoming two teams (B2B Marketing, Consumer Marketing)
- All 24 current roles are preserved—no redundancies
- 8 people will have new managers
- 4 people will have new job titles (same level)
- Effective in 3 weeks

**Why:**
- Better alignment with sales organisation (which is segment-aligned)
- Reduce duplication of effort across product teams
- Improve customer journey consistency
- Enable more specialised expertise by segment

**What happens next:**
- Individual conversations with affected people this week
- New team assignments confirmed by Friday
- Transition period: 2 weeks of knowledge transfer
- New structure fully operational from [date]

**Sensitivities:**
- Previous reorg 18 months ago created anxiety
- Some people may prefer their current manager
- B2B team will be larger than Consumer team (may feel like "winners and losers")

---

### Exercise: Change communication

```
Context: Marketing department reorg—3 teams to 2 teams, no job losses, 
8 people getting new managers. Previous reorg 18 months ago was 
poorly received. Need to announce to all 24 people in the department.

Request: Draft the announcement addressing:
1. What's changing (specific and clear)
2. Why (business rationale, not corporate speak)
3. What stays the same (job security, levels)
4. What happens next (timeline, individual conversations)
5. Anticipated concerns and how to address them

Tone: Transparent, factual, empathetic. Avoid corporate jargon.
