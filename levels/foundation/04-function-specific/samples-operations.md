## Sample 1: Process Description for Analysis

**Context:** The following describes the current purchase order approval process. Leadership has asked for improvement recommendations.

---

### Current Process: Purchase Order Approval

**Process Owner:** Finance Operations  
**Volume:** ~400 POs per month  
**Current avg. cycle time:** 4.2 days

**Step 1: Request Submission**
Requester completes PO request form in shared Excel file on network drive. Form includes vendor details, item description, quantity, estimated cost, cost centre, and business justification. Requester emails their line manager to notify them a request is pending.

**Step 2: Line Manager Approval**
Line manager reviews request in the Excel file. If approved, they add their initials and date to the approval column. They then email Finance with "PO Ready for Processing" in the subject line.

**Step 3: Finance Review**
Finance team member checks request against budget, verifies vendor is in approved supplier list, confirms cost centre coding is correct. If issues found, they email the requester and process stops until resolved.

**Step 4: Finance Approval**
For requests under £5,000: Finance Manager approves by adding initials to Excel.
For requests £5,000-£25,000: Finance Director must approve.
For requests over £25,000: CFO approval required (typically adds 2-3 days).

**Step 5: PO Generation**
Once approved, Finance Admin creates PO in the ERP system, generates PDF, and emails to vendor. Copy saved to shared drive.

**Step 6: Confirmation**
Requester receives email confirmation with PO number.

**Known Issues:**
- Excel file frequently has version conflicts when multiple people access
- Requests sometimes "lost" if emails missed
- No visibility into where requests are in the process
- CFO approval creates bottleneck for large purchases
- No audit trail beyond email threads

### Exercise: Process analysis

```
Context: Purchase order approval process handling 400 POs/month, 
average 4.2 days cycle time. Uses Excel on shared drive and email 
for workflow. Known issues with version conflicts, lost requests, 
and lack of visibility.

Language: Analytical, practical. Focus on actionable improvements.

Examples: Categorise findings as:
- Quick wins (< 2 weeks, minimal cost)
- Medium-term (1-3 months, moderate investment)
- Strategic (requires capital/project)

Audience: Operations leadership evaluating improvement options.

Request: Analyse this process and provide:
1. Identification of inefficiencies and bottlenecks
2. Risk assessment (what could go wrong, what's the impact)
3. Improvement recommendations in the three categories above
4. Estimated impact of each recommendation
```

## Sample 2: Project Scenario for Risk Register

**Context:** You're planning a system migration project and need to develop a risk register.

---

### Project: ERP System Migration

**Overview:**
- Migrating from legacy on-premise ERP to cloud-based solution
- 18-month implementation timeline
- £2.5M budget (software, implementation, change management)
- 800 users across 5 locations
- Go-live planned for July next year

**Key Dependencies:**
- Data migration from 15-year-old system (data quality unknown)
- Integration with 12 connected systems
- Vendor implementation partner capacity
- Internal IT team availability (also supporting BAU)
- User training and adoption

**Constraints:**
- Year-end freeze: No changes November-January
- Key staff member retiring in 6 months
- Parallel run required for minimum 1 month

---

### Exercise: Risk register development

```
Context: 18-month ERP migration, £2.5M budget, 800 users. 
Key dependencies on data migration, integrations, vendor capacity, 
and user adoption. Year-end freeze constraint.

Language: Structured, comprehensive. Use standard risk management terminology.

Examples: Format as a risk register table:
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Score | Mitigation | Owner | Early Warning |

Audience: Project governance board—they need to understand and approve risk exposure.

Request: Create a risk register with:
1. 10-12 likely risks for this type of project
2. For each: likelihood (H/M/L), impact (H/M/L), risk score
3. Mitigation strategies
4. Suggested risk owners by function
5. Early warning indicators
```
