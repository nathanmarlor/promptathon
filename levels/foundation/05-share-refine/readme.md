# Level 5: Share & Refine

| | |
|---|---|
| **Difficulty** | ⭐ Group Activity |
| **Time** | 5–10 minutes |
| **Tool** | Group Discussion |
| **Skill** | Collaborative learning and prompt optimisation |

---

## Objective

Learn from peers' experiences and develop the skill of systematically improving prompts based on observed outcomes.

---

## Business Context

Collective learning accelerates capability development. Sharing what works (and what doesn't) builds institutional knowledge and reduces repeated trial-and-error.

---

## Part A: Share with the Group

Take 2-3 minutes to share your experience from Levels 1-4.

### Discussion Points

**What worked well?**
- Share a prompt that produced genuinely useful output
- What made it effective?

**Where did AI fall short?**
- What did you have to correct or supplement?
- Was the issue with your prompt or AI's limitations?

**What surprised you?**
- Results that exceeded expectations?
- Unexpected limitations?

---

## Part B: Collaborative Refinement

As a group, take a prompt that partially worked and improve it together.

### Process

**Step 1: Review the Output**
What specifically is wrong or missing? Be precise.

**Step 2: Diagnose Using CLEAR**
Which component was weakest?
- **Context** — Did AI understand the situation?
- **Language** — Was the tone/style right?
- **Examples** — Did you show what you wanted?
- **Audience** — Did AI calibrate appropriately?
- **Request** — Was the deliverable clear?

**Step 3: Rewrite the Prompt**
Strengthen the weak component(s)

**Step 4: Test and Compare**
Run the improved prompt and evaluate the difference

## Group Discussion Questions

Consider these questions as a team:

1. Which CLEAR component made the biggest difference when improved?
2. What patterns do you notice in prompts that work well?
3. How much iteration was typically needed for usable output?
4. What tasks is AI surprisingly good at?
5. What tasks is AI surprisingly poor at?

---

## Foundation Levels Complete

You've completed the Foundation levels (1-5). You now have:

✅ Experience using AI for summarisation, drafting, and decision support  
✅ Familiarity with the CLEAR framework  
✅ Insight from peer experiences  
✅ A sense of AI's capabilities and limitations
