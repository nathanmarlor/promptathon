# Facilitator Discussion Guide

Use this guide to run the group sharing and refinement activity.

---

## Setup (2 minutes)

- Ensure everyone has completed at least 2-3 of the previous levels
- Have participants open their most successful and least successful prompts
- Prepare to capture insights on a shared screen or whiteboard

---

## Part A: Individual Sharing (10 minutes)

### Round 1: Successes (5 minutes)

Go around the group. Each person shares:
- One prompt that worked well
- What made it effective (30 seconds each)

**Facilitator prompts:**
- "What was the key to getting good output?"
- "Which CLEAR component do you think made the difference?"

### Round 2: Challenges (5 minutes)

Each person shares:
- One prompt that didn't work as expected
- What went wrong (30 seconds each)

**Facilitator prompts:**
- "Was the issue with your prompt or AI's limitations?"
- "What would you do differently?"

---

## Part B: Group Refinement (10 minutes)

### Select a Prompt (2 minutes)

Choose one prompt from the group that:
- Partially worked but needed improvement
- Represents a common task type
- Has clear room for improvement

### Diagnose Together (3 minutes)

As a group, analyse using CLEAR:
- Which component is weakest?
- What's missing?
- What could be clearer?

### Rewrite Together (3 minutes)

Collaboratively improve the prompt:
- Focus on the weakest 1-2 components
- Be specific about changes

### Test and Compare (2 minutes)

Run the improved prompt and compare results.

---

## Part C: Synthesis (5 minutes)

### Capture Key Patterns

Ask the group:
1. "What patterns do we see in prompts that work well?"
2. "What common mistakes should we avoid?"
3. "What did we learn about AI's strengths and limitations?"

### Document for Reference

Capture:
- 3-5 effective prompt patterns
- 2-3 common pitfalls
- Any task-specific insights

## Discussion Questions Bank

Use these if conversation needs prompting:

**On effectiveness:**
- "What surprised you about how AI interpreted your prompt?"
- "Where did adding context make the biggest difference?"
- "When did examples help vs when were they unnecessary?"

**On limitations:**
- "What tasks required significant human editing regardless of prompt?"
- "Where did AI make assumptions you didn't expect?"
- "What can't AI do that you thought it might?"

**On application:**
- "Which task from today will you use AI for regularly?"
- "What would need to change for you to trust AI output without review?"
- "How might this change how you work?"

---

## Wrap-Up

**Remind participants:**
- Save effective prompts for reuse
- The goal is productivity, not perfection
- Iteration is normal—expect 2-3 refinements
- Human review remains essential

**Preview next section:**
- Intermediate levels introduce Excel and more complex workflows
- Advanced levels use Claude for sophisticated analysis
