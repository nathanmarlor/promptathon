# Level 7: Excel Financial Modelling

| | |
|---|---|
| **Difficulty** | ⭐⭐ Intermediate |
| **Time** | 15–20 minutes |
| **Tool** | Microsoft 365 Copilot in Excel |
| **Skill** | Build and enhance financial models with AI assistance |

---

## Objective

Use Copilot to accelerate the creation and enhancement of financial models, templates, and analytical frameworks in Excel.

---

## Business Context

Copilot can help build model components, create dynamic formulas, and add analytical capabilities—reducing manual effort whilst maintaining rigour.

---

## Sample Materials

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [sample-budget-data.csv](sample-budget-data.csv) | Budget vs actual data for modelling exercises |
| [model-requirements.md](model-requirements.md) | Sample specifications for models to build |

---

## Your Task

**Choose one track:**

**Track A:** Create a new model from requirements  
**Track B:** Enhance existing data with calculations and scenarios  
**Track C:** Build a template for recurring analysis

## Starter Prompts

### Building Model Components

```
Context: I need a [model type] model for [purpose]. This will be used 
[frequency: monthly/quarterly] by [who].

Language: Clear structure, well-labelled. Follow financial modelling best practices.

Examples: Structure as:
- Inputs section (highlighted, editable)
- Calculations section (formulas, protected)
- Outputs section (summary dashboard)

Audience: [Who will use this]—they have [skill level] Excel skills.

Request: Create a [model type] model with:
- Input section for: [list key inputs]
- Calculation section that: [describe calculations]
- Output section showing: [list key outputs]

Use best practices: clear input cells, named ranges, summary at top.
```

### Scenario Analysis

```
Context: I have a model that needs scenario capability for [decision/planning].
Key variables that could change: [list 2-3 variables].

Language: Clear labelling of scenarios and assumptions.

Examples: Three scenarios:
- Base case (current assumptions)
- Upside case (optimistic)
- Downside case (pessimistic)

Audience: [Decision-makers] who need to understand range of outcomes.

Request: Add scenario analysis capability to this model:
- Base case: [current assumptions]
- Upside case: [optimistic assumptions]
- Downside case: [pessimistic assumptions]
Create a dropdown to toggle between scenarios.
```

## Success Criteria

✅ Model structure follows best practices  
✅ Inputs, calculations, and outputs are clearly separated  
✅ No hardcoded numbers in calculations  
✅ Model is documented and understandable
