## Sample Materials

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [sample-budget-data.csv](sample-budget-data.csv) | Budget vs actual data for modelling exercises |
| [model-requirements.md](model-requirements.md) | Sample specifications for models to build |

---

## Your Task

**Choose one track:**

**Track A:** Create a new model from requirements  
**Track B:** Enhance existing data with calculations and scenarios  
**Track C:** Build a template for recurring analysis  

---

## Starter Prompts

### Building Model Components

```
Create a [model type] model structure with:
- Input section for: [list key inputs]
- Calculation section that: [describe calculations]
- Output section showing: [list key outputs]

Use best practices:
- Clear input cells (highlighted)
- Named ranges for key variables
- Summary outputs at the top
```

### Scenario Analysis

```
Add scenario analysis capability to this model:
- Base case: [current assumptions]
- Upside case: [optimistic assumptions]
- Downside case: [pessimistic assumptions]

Create a dropdown to toggle between scenarios.
```

## Success Criteria

✅ Model structure follows best practices  
✅ Inputs, calculations, and outputs are clearly separated  
✅ No hardcoded numbers in calculations  
✅ Model is documented and understandable
