## Sample CLEAR Prompt

\`\`\`
Context: I need to inform the board about a project 
delay. First major delay on this initiative.

Language: Professional, confident, solution-oriented. 
Not defensive or apologetic.

Examples: Structure like Sarah's Q3 budget email — 
issue first, brief cause, recovery plan.

Audience: Board members (non-technical). They want: 
impact, timeline, risk. Not: technical details.

Request: 200-word email with:
- Direct subject line
- Key message in first sentence
- Cause (2-3 sentences)
- Recovery actions
- Next steps
