# Practical AI Use Cases

Quick-win applications by function. These are low-effort, high-return uses where AI saves time without requiring expertise.

## Is This a Good Candidate?

Before using AI, run through this checklist:

| ✅ Good Candidate | ❌ Poor Candidate |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Repetitive task you do weekly/monthly | One-off task you'll never repeat |
| Text-heavy (writing, summarising, structuring) | Requires proprietary data or systems |
| You'll review before it goes anywhere | Needs to be right first time, no review |
| Output is a draft or input to your thinking | Output is a final decision |
| Time saved > time to write the prompt | Faster to just do it yourself |

**The sweet spot:** Tasks where you'd spend 20+ minutes that AI can draft in 2, and you spend 5 minutes reviewing.

## What Good Looks Like

**Before AI:**
- Stare at blank page for 10 minutes
- Write draft in 30 minutes
- Realise structure is wrong
- Rewrite in 20 minutes
- **Total: 60 minutes**

**With AI:**
- Write prompt in 2 minutes
- Get draft in 30 seconds
- Edit for tone and specifics in 10 minutes
- **Total: 12 minutes**

The output quality is similar. The difference is where you spend your time: creating vs editing.

## Common Patterns That Work

### 1. "Draft this, I'll edit"
```
Draft a [type of communication] about [topic].
Key points to include: [list]
Tone: [professional/friendly/urgent]
```
You review, adjust tone, add specifics.

### 2. "Summarise this for [audience]"
```
Summarise this [document/thread] for [who].
They need to know: [what they care about]
Keep it under [length].
```
You verify accuracy, add context they'd need.

### 3. "Help me prepare"
```
I have a meeting with [who] about [topic].
What questions should I ask?
What might they raise?
What should I make sure to cover?
```
You filter based on what you know about the relationship.

### 4. "Structure my thinking"
```
I'm trying to [decision/problem].
Here's what I'm thinking: [rough notes]
Help me structure this into [format].
```
You validate the logic, add what's missing.

## What to Watch For

| Risk | How to Avoid |
|------|--------------|
| **Sounds generic** | Add more context about your specific situation |
| **Facts wrong** | Never trust numbers, dates, or claims you didn't provide |
| **Tone off** | Always read output as if you're the recipient |
| **Missing context** | AI doesn't know your relationships or history |
| **Over-reliance** | Use for drafts and structure, not decisions |

## Getting Started

**This week:** Pick one repetitive task from the list above. Try AI for the draft. Note time saved.

**This month:** Build 3-5 go-to prompts for tasks you do regularly. Save them somewhere accessible.

**Ongoing:** Share what works with your team. The best prompts spread.

## The Bottom Line

AI is useful for:
- **First drafts** — faster to edit than create from scratch
- **Structure** — turning messy thinking into organised output
- **Summarising** — extracting what matters from volume
- **Preparation** — thinking through what you might miss

AI is not useful for:
- **Decisions** — it provides input, you decide
- **Relationships** — it doesn't know your context
- **Accuracy** — it can be confidently wrong
- **Judgement** — that's still your job

The goal isn't transformation. It's getting 30 minutes back on tasks that don't need your full attention.
